# Disclaimer

This repository contains **research content** intended for academic and educational use only.  
Nothing herein constitutes investment, legal, accounting, or tax advice.

## Scope & Assumptions
- Findings apply to **non-stablecoin pairs** unless explicitly stated; stable–stable pools are **out of scope** for the main claim.
- Net LP profitability is measured as **Profit = Fees − LVR − Gas**. Where a study omits any component (e.g., gas or re-range costs), that omission is noted.
- Different studies use different markouts, fee tiers, and sampling windows. Cross-study comparisons are **qualitative** unless stated otherwise.

## Data & Reproducibility
- Where possible, numbers are taken directly from the cited papers. Raw extractions (if any) belong in `data/raw/`; tidy data used for figures are in `data/processed/`.
- Figures are generated by the scripts in `src/`. Results may vary with environment, library versions, and data revisions.

## Limitations
- **Time-in-range** and **gas/re-range** assumptions significantly affect v3 outcomes. If not reported, we do not impute.
- **Infrastructure changes** (e.g., block time, routing) can shift LVR dynamics over time. Re-evaluation is recommended as conditions evolve.
- This synthesis focuses on **LP outcomes**; it does not judge protocol-level objectives (e.g., price discovery, depth, or trader surplus).
